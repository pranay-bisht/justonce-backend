# JustOnce Backend

This repository contains the backend service for **JustOnce**, a minimal web application focused on creating a pause between impulse and action.

The backend is responsible for handling subscriptions, storing data securely, and managing automated, opt-in email delivery with strict ethical boundaries.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

**JustOnce is not therapy and does not replace professional help.**  
If gambling is causing significant distress or harm, speaking with a qualified mental health professional can be valuable.

The backend supports occasional newsletters intended as quiet reflections — not advice, treatment, or behavioral intervention.
